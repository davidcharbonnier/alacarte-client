# Next Steps - Before Testing Gin

## ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED: Generate Localization Files

We added new localization strings during this session. You must run this command:

```bash
cd /home/david/perso/alacarte-client
flutter gen-l10n
```

**This generates:**
- `searchItemsByName()` method
- All other localization methods from `.arb` files

**Without this, you'll see errors like:**
- `The method 'searchItemsByName' isn't defined for the type 'AppLocalizations'`
